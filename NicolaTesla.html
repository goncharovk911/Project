       <h2 id="headline">Chronology of the life of Nikola Tesla</h2>
       <li><strong>1856</strong> - Nikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the
         village Smiljan, Lika county, in the Austrian Empire.</li>
       <li><strong>1861</strong> - Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where
          he studied German, arithmetic, and religion.Nikola completed primary
          school, followed by middle school.</li>
       <li><strong>1870</strong> - In 1870, Tesla moved far north to Karlovac to
         attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium.Tesla would later write
          that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by his
          physics professor. Tesla noted that these demonstrations of this
           "mysterious phenomena" made him want "to know more of this wonderful
            force". He finished a four-year term in three years, graduating
            in 1873.</li>
       <li><strong>1875</strong> - Tesla enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic in
         Graz, Austria, on a Military Frontier scholarship. During his first
         year, Tesla never missed a lecture, earned the highest grades possible,
          passed nine exams (nearly twice as many as required), started a Serb
          cultural club, and even received a letter of commendation from the
          dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated,
           "Your son is a star of first rank."During his second year, Tesla came
            into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo, when
            Tesla suggested that commutators were not necessary.At the end of
             his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to
             gambling. During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance
             and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and
             returning the balance to his family.When examination time came,
             Tesla was unprepared and asked for an extension to study, but was
             denied. He did not receive grades for the last semester of the
             third year and he never graduated from the university.</li>
       <li><strong>1881</strong> - Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, to work
         under Tivadar Puskás at a telegraph company, the Budapest
         Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company,
          then under construction, was not functional, so he worked as a
           draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few
            months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, and
             Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position. During his
              employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station
               equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or
                amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.</li>
       <li><strong>1882</strong> - Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris
          with the Continental Edison Company. Tesla began working in what
           was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting
            citywide in the form of an electric power utility.</li>
       <li><strong>1885</strong> - Tesla emigrated to the United States.
          Where  got a job at Edison Machine Works. Tesla had to develop an
           arc-based street lighting system. Soon there was a conflict between
            Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla when Thomas Edison himself suggested
             and then refused the deal, said: "Tesla, you do not understand our
              American humor." At the end of 1885, Tesla left the factory and
               said: “Goodbye, Edison Machine Works”.</li>
       <li><strong>1887</strong> - Together Charles F. Peck they formed the
         Tesla Electric Company in  with an agreement that profits from
         generated patents would go 1/3 to Tesla, 1/3 to Peck and Brown, and 1/3
          to fund development. They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89
          Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and
          developing new types of electric motors, generators, and other devices.
          Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current (AC)
          , a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the
           United States because of its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage
            transmission. The money Tesla made from licensing his AC patents
            made him independently wealthy and gave him the time and funds to'
             pursue his own interests.</li>
       <li><strong>1889</strong> - Tesla traveled to the  Exposition Universelle
          in Paris and learned of Heinrich Hertz' 1886–88 experiments that
           proved the existence of electromagnetic radiation, including radio
            waves. Tesla found this new discovery "refreshing" and decided to
             explore it more fully. In repeating, and then expanding on, these
              experiments, Tesla tried powering a Ruhmkorff coil with a high
               speed alternator he had been developing as part of an improved
                arc lighting system but found that the high-frequency current
                 overheated the iron core and melted the insulation between the
                  primary and secondary windings in the coil. To fix this problem
                   Tesla came up with his Tesla coil with an air gap instead of
                    insulating material between the primary and secondary windings
                    and an iron core that could be moved to different positions
                     in or out of the coil.</li>
       <li><strong>1893</strong> -
Tesla developed a steam powered reciprocating electricity generator. He patented
 it in and introduced it at the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition that year.</li>
       <li><strong>1894</strong> - From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a
         great deal of his time and fortune on a series of projects trying to
         develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an
         xpansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been
          demonstrating in wireless lighting. He saw this as not only a way to
          transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had
          pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide
          communications.</li>
       <li><strong>1906</strong> -
Tesla demonstrated a 200 horsepower (150 kilowatts) 16,000 rpm bladeless turbine.
During 1910–1911, at the Waterside Power Station in New York, several of his
bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100–5,000 hp. </li>

    <li><strong>1931</strong> - Tesla on Time magazine commemorating his 75th birthday
 Tesla received congratulatory letters from more than 70 pioneers in science and
  engineering, including Albert Einstein,and he was also featured on the cover of
   Time magazine. The cover caption "All the world's his power house" noted his
   contribution to electrical power generation.</li>
   <li><strong>1943</strong> -
At the age of 86, Tesla died alone in Room 3327 of the New Yorker Hotel.
 Assistant medical examiner H.W. Wembley examined the body and ruled that the
 cause of death had been coronary thrombosis.</li>
